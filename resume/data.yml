knowledge: Some of my projects include making a web-based lyrics api to fetch lyrics for songs, making a schedule manager android app to manage part time job schedules,
           as well as a report card comment generator that allows teachers to generate report card comments for students in their class based on their grades.  

projects:

- name: GPA Converter / Grade Calculator
  platform: React.JS, Node.JS, Bootstrap, Puppeteer, Docker
  # description: Report Card Comment Generator is an app made in VB.NET that was made for teachers to generate report card comments for students within a few click and saving the teachers time. The app took a file with student names and grades as an input and the output was a list of comments for the student. The app also was catered towards a report card logging service called HomeLogic and worked to export the comments directly to the Homelogic service once they were generated. The generation used libraries such as NHunspell to generate unique comments using different words.
  points:
    - This is a <b>dockerized</b> web application that converts York University's 9.0 GPA Scale to the 4.0 GPA Scale. Additionally, it also helps to calculate grades. 
    - The frontend uses <b>ReactJS</b> to calculate and render the GPA where as the backend is maintained using <b>ExpressJS</b> which is used optionally to scrape data straight from York's grades page using <b>puppeteer</b> which is outputted back to the frontend using <b>JSON</b>.  
    - The app further consists of saving/importing features to save data locally as JSON to be able to recalculate in further sessions.

- name: Lyrics API
  platform: Vue.JS, Node.JS, MongoDB, IBM Carbon Design System, Swagger, Python
  timeperiod: February 2016
  # description: A web application that serves as a way to provide lyrics to songs in the form of an API. The frontend made in VueJS using the Carbon Design System consists of a website explaining the api, the documentation behind the api calls as well as a way for users to create an account to request keys for api authentication etc. The backend service is maintained using express and consists entirely of api calls and returned requests. A python script in the backend is also active which scrapes the lyrics for songs matching a particular keyword and adds to the mongoDB database which is accessed by the api. 
  points:
    - Lyrics API is as a <b>dockerized</b> web application that provides lyrics to songs in the form of <b>API</b> requests.
    - Frontend of the web application is made in <b>Vue</b> using the <b> IBM Carbon Design System</b> providing users with API documentation alongside API key management service. 
    - The backend service is maintained using <b>ExpressJS</b> and consists entirely of api calls and returned requests. 
    - <b>Python</b> scripts in the backend also act to <b>scrape</b> the lyrics for songs from Genius.com using the <b>BeautifulSoup</b> library and then adding the data to the <b>MongoDB</b> database which is then accessible by the end-users through api calls.

- name: Schedule Manager
